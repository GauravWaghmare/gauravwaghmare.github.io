In this season of Serial, Sarah Koenig untangles the dark web of the War on Terror, the American soldiers, the Taliban and the Afghan People. At the centre of the discussion is Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl. As the first season of Serial, Sarah takes us into very interesting details of this equally complicated war, and how war plays out on a personal level in a soldiers mind.

It all starts with Bowe willingly walking off his post at OP Mest as a way to register his grave concern about the condition of his platoon. His plan goes awry when he is captured by the Taliban and put through a harrowing ordeal for five years. In my opinion, the fact that Bowe kept his sanity after all of distress, discomfort and disease is no mean feat.

While Bowe presents his case and explains his actions, we also hear from his platoon mates about how they feel. They say Bowe broke the code by deserting them in the middle of nowhere. Sarah also makes time to discuss the American counterinsurgency (COIN) strategy of fighting the Taliban and rebuilding Afghanistan. To hear people say that the strategy wasn’t yielding the desired results in 2016 i.e., the time at which the podcast was recorded is revealing. It all totally makes sense, now that we have seen how America’s withdrawal from Afghanistan turned out.

Pakistan is in the picture too. Bowe was kept in Pakistan under the security provided by the Haqqani Network, which though is a terrorist organization, has an agreement with the Pakistani Army to conduct its business. The Taliban moved Bow to Pakistan because the American forces cannot conduct search and rescue operations in Pakistan, it is an ally, sovereign, etc.

We come to the politics of it and hear how politicians tried to further their own agenda using Bow, and how it is unsettling for Bowe’s mates to see him not being held accountable for his actions. The whole story does have a Saving Private Ryan flavour to it as another lingering question is did anyone lose their life while they were looking for Bowe. The season ends with our host discussing how war is hard and how placing blame in this scenario is difficult. Bowe faced court-martial and is sentenced to a dishonourable discharge.

Serial keeps the benchmark high with its second season. I could hear the amount of hard work that went into gathering all the details from government officials, army officials, Bowe, Bowe’s platoonmates and many others. It’s thrilling with all the military terms (like DUSTWUN) and action and adds a humane layer with the war. Do listen if you are interested in geopolitics, internal military affairs and the effect of war on personnel.
