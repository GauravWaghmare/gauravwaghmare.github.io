This book by Dr Siddhartha Mukherjee is an unexpected page-turner, especially during the pandemic where an RNA virus has wreaked havoc across the world. The book, as he himself calls it, is an 'intimate history' of how the human race came to understand genetics, how genetics was weaponized by certain groups like the Nazis and how genes explain our identity.
    
Through the book, the author explains how the information to fully develop a body from infant to adult is encoded in our DNA and then how that same information is used to synthesize proteins - the building blocks of life. 
    
The first hero in the story is Gregor Mendel who experimented with hybrid peas and came up with the concept of dominant and recessive traits. These ‘traits’ are information that is passed onto future generations, and this ‘information’ that could be passed on from generation to generation would later become known as the gene. Mendel’s work would not be deemed significant for decades.
    
Next in the book comes Charles Darwin, whose expedition to the Galapagos Islands eventually unravelled the theory of evolution. I can’t imagine how audacious and blasphemous it would have been for Darwin to tell the world that humans have descended from apes and are not a result of divine creation. His book On The Origin Of Species explained how random errors in passing genetic information and the quest for survival led to creation of new dominant species. The same book would join the ranks of Principia Mathematica by Isaac Newton as one of the most influential scientific books in history.
    
The discovery of the molecule that passes hereditary information is yet another thrilling story. DNA was initially ruled out as the carrier of genetic information, but as evidence mounted its role was finally ascertained by Oswald Avery. At this point, it feels, all the findings from Mendel, Darwin and several others finally culminated and gave us the molecule of life. 

Following the discovery of DNA the project to sequence the entire human genome or the Human Genome Project was started. Never knew a scientific conquest such as that could have had political overtones. All the terms used in this part of the book like polymerase chain reaction have entered common parlance now with the coronavirus checks becoming mundane. The RT-PCR or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction is used to check if a nose/throat swab sample contains the RNA of the SARS-Cov-2 virus responsible for the current global mayhem. It is a variation of the same techniques used by researchers to sequence the human genome.

The discovery of DNA, its role and the Human Genome Project improved our understanding of the human body and many diseases like cancer and Schizophrenia. As new techniques like CRISPR are developed, a brave new world is unravelled where cure for such diseases is in sight.

The book is interspersed with the author’s own experience and is really hard to put down till the end. It is a must read for not just those in the biology of genetics but also the history.
