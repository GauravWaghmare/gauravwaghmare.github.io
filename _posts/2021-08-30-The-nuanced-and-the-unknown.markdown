There was no word for the colour blue in several languages in ancient times<sup>[*][ref1]</sup>, so to infer that not everything that exists can be explained is not too much to ask for. In his book [Antifragile][ref2], Nassim Nicholas Taleb argues that truth in the real word is nuanced and hence cannot be put into words accurately, which I wholeheartedly agree with. Any attempt to do so would lead to loss of information. This can be extended to not just the truth but to future projections as well. Because the premise itself is error prone, so would the projection, which in itself would be missing a lot of information.
