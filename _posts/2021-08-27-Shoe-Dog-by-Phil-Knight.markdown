Phil Knight tells his story of doing what he truly believed in and ultimately creating Nike. The book is a wonderful tale of a young Phil who has this ‘crazy idea’ of selling shoes. Along with his coach Bowerman, he starts the blue ribbon company which would pave the way for Nike, Inc.

The book takes us through all the phases of Phil’s venture and all that he had to go through to beat Adidas in their own game. He indicates clearly that to build something big is never an easy ride. He had to go through a heartbreak, machinations by his Japanese partner, being reported to the FBI for alleged fraud, harassment by the US government on the behest of his competitors, and all the while keeping up with customer’s rising demand and expectations for and from Nike footwear. He along with his colleagues - Bowerman, Johnson, Woodell, Hayes and Strasser were running a very tight ship and veering it frequently to avoid icebergs. Phil also talks about his emotions as he goes through all this, acquiescing that he is a human, and panic and anger are part of the deal.

Bowerman and Johnson are the very supportive characters in this story. Bowerman, not just a coach, but also an innovator (tinkerer would be a better word to describe his spirit) takes forward the designs of the shoes. One of those designs was prototyped using a waffle iron, and became a bestseller. Johnson was a devoted employee of the company, and his talents were utilised all the time, be it for opening the first store on either coasts or setting up their first factory on American soil in Exeter. Both of them deserve high credits for their contributions to the company.

Phil, like every other founder, cared for his company and his role in shaping its future. Reluctant at first to take Nike public, he realizes that taking his company public would be a way to make it long lasting. Much like making a piece of code open source increases its life beyond its creator’s ;)

Phil does talk about struggling with work-life balance which in his case had more work than life. I am curious to know Penny’s (his wife) or Travis’s (his son) side of the story. Is there no such thing as a perfect work-life balance even for people who are very successful?
Another interesting take would come from the erstwhile employees of Blue Ribbon and Nike, and how they see all these events narrated by our author.

The book closes with our protagonist reflecting on his life, and the ending is nicely done. He talks about where all his colleagues are now, and he feels grateful to have touched so many lives through his business. By the end of the book I felt part of the story and felt sad that the adventures from a world trip to taking Nike public ended here, while Phil thinks of his next ‘crazy idea’.

The book is inspiring at every page and stands as a testament to the idea that if you manage to stay in the field long enough, you will eventually win.

## Favorite quotes

- Like it or not, life is a game.

- Whatever pleasures or gains you derive from the act of running, you must find them within. It’s all in how you frame it, how you sell it to yourself.

- Let everyone else call your idea crazy . . . just keep going. Don’t stop. Don’t even think about stopping until you get there, and don’t give much thought to where “there” is. Whatever comes, just don’t stop.

- People, sensing my belief, wanted some of that belief for themselves.

- Fight not to win, but to avoid losing. A surefire losing strategy.

- War is the most extreme of conditions. But business has its warlike parallels.

- Starting my own business was the only thing that made life’s other risks—marriage, Vegas, alligator wrestling—seem like sure things.

- And those who urge entrepreneurs to never give up? Charlatans. Sometimes you have to give up. Sometimes knowing when to give up, when to try something else, is genius. Giving up doesn’t mean stopping. Don’t ever stop.

- Have faith in yourself, but also have faith in faith. Not faith as others define it. Faith as you define it. Faith as faith defines itself in your heart.
