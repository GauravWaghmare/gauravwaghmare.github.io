# Thinking, Fast and Slow

This is my fourth book from an Israeli author and he maintains the bar raised by the others, especially Yuval Noah Harari. This book takes you on a satisfying train of revelations where every stop is a deeply hidden bias. All these biases are confirmed by real world studies, which shows how common they are and also tells how they are hidden in plain sight, and we will see how all these biases should be kept in mind while making decisions. With the metric of insightfulness per page skyrocketing, this isn't an easy book to summarize.
 
In the early chapters of the book, the author, who also happens to be the winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, talks about recency and availability biases. Availability bias is when we assume the probability of an event based on the availability of similar events in our memory. Recency bias is similar with the mental source of the event being the recent past. For example, we would judge flight crashes to be frequent if one had happened in the recent past, even though data would show otherwise - flight crashes are a very rare event.
 
Then we move to how our mind is biased towards explanations that represent a coherent story. The book also mentions a Linda experiment wherein multiple descriptions (or evidences) are given for the women, and the subjects of the experiment had to choose among multiple options the one that seemed most plausible to them. For example the descriptions were :-
 
- Linda is a primary school teacher
- Linda is a bank teller
- Linda is a feminist
 
and the options were
 
- Linda is a feminist
- Linda is a feminist bank teller
 
If you picked the second option then you are in majority. Rationally, an event is more improbable if more details are added to it. But because the second option presents a more coherent story, our mind goes for it.
 
Next we read about how a gain of 1 million dollars for a person with no money is of more value than to a person with 500 thousand dollars in his bank account. While intuitively it does make sense given diminishing value of money, the concept discussed here is of how the reference point matters.
 
The reference point for a person with no money is clearly lower than for a person with more money than him. Same can be extended to loss as well. But then comes the twist, a gain of 1 million dollars will result in lesser elation than the loss of 1 millions dollars will result in sorrow, and we go on to read about the multiplicative factor at which gains and losses cause the same amount of emotion.
 
Another twist, what if a person with no money is given a chance to win 1 million dollars and he takes the chance. On losing the chance the person will still feel sad, but wasn't the reference point for the person at 0. It was, but it changed because of their expectation from the chance.
 
We also read about how we tend to overestimate the probability of rare events and underestimate the probability of very likely events, the examples of which are all around. When buying a lottery the real chances of winning are less than 1% but we overestimate that chance and buy a ticket. Or when we buy life insurance, the chances of living beyond the insurance term are higher than 99% but we underestimate that chance and buy into it.
 
A boy was good at chess when he was in school. What are the chances that he would be a rich lawyer now? If you have an answer to these questions, chances are that you assumed a correlation between being good at chess and being a skilled lawyer while there might not be any. We do such translations all the time in life if you observe keenly.
 
Ever heard of a big complex project (construction, IT or otherwise) that finished on time and without cost overruns? If not, most likely the planners did an internal assessment of the project and arrived on the cost-time numbers and didn't look outwards. Had they done that then they would have seen that almost all big projects fail to meet the projected costs and timelines, and would have accounted for that in their case.
 
Ten paragraphs over but this still is just a very minor fraction of the insights in the book. The author makes a very strong case to establish any evidence given to us first and compare it with objects of similar class. It's a tough book to read and grasp (not to forget to summarize), but making it through is absolutely worth it. After all, knowing our biases helps us avoid irrational behaviour and make better decisions.


## Favorite quotes

- Too much concern about how well one is doing in a task sometimes disrupts performance by loading short-term memory with pointless anxious thoughts

- The illusion that one has understood the past feeds the further illusion that one can predict and control the future.

- We reach the point of diminishing marginal predictive returns for knowledge disconcertingly quickly,
